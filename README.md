# Capture the Flags 3D
The game was inspired by the Capture The Flags game created during the ShellHacks 2022 hackathon. There, I collaborated with a partner and learned the Godot engine in order to help create the game. To accommodate my partner's skill set, I flexibly went through the Python basics along with the engine's tutorial. This had sparked my interest in creating games as a part of applications.

After improving myself in the hackathon, I took the opportunity to continue and ultimately remake the game on the Unity engine. The engine switch was essential in order to use the C# language and better platform support.

The initial development process of the Unity game was entirely based on the Create with Code course. This meant creating the world floor, prototype models and movement, game mechanics; GUI, then audio. After the tutorial, I added extra features including the difficulty system and fixed any bugs present during the development. What was considered for future updates included support for multiplayer.
